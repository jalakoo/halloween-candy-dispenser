# HALLOWEEN CANDY DISPENSER
This is the Python code for a Halloween dispensing robot head, optionally
covered by a scary mask.

### EXPERIENCE
When someone at a distance is detected, the head will whisper a phrase
like one of the following:

- “Come closer”
- “Hey you. Yeah. Over here”
- “I have something for you”

When someone gets very close the head will make a regurgitating 
sound + dispense a candy pack for each person detected at this range, once 
the candy is dispensed it will say something like one of the following:

- “Those are fresh, I ate them with the last trick-or-treater”
- “You should dry that off before you eat”
- “Hope you enjoy those more than I did”

### REQUIREMENTS
Valid alwaysAI credentials to use the alwaysAI computer vision platform.
This allows for rapid development and deployment of the app onto an edge 
device (like a raspberry pi) without requiring it to have internet access.
