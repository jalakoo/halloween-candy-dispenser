# HALLOWEEN CANDY DISPENSER
This is the Python code for a Halloween dispensing robot head, optionally
covered by a scary mask.

### EXPERIENCE
When someone at a distance is detected, the head will whisper a phrase
like one of the following:

- “Come closer”
- “Hey you. Yeah. Over here”
- “I have something for you”

When someone gets very close the head will make a regurgitating 
sound + dispense a candy pack for each person detected at this range, once 
the candy is dispensed it will say something like one of the following:

- “Those are fresh, I ate them with the last trick-or-treater”
- “You should dry that off before you eat”
- “Hope you enjoy those more than I did”

### REQUIREMENTS

### TROUBLESHOOTING
ERROR:
```
WARNING: The directory '/.cache/pip/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
```
SOLUTION:
Make sure you're using the `==` symbol in your `requirements.txt` file. ie `simpleaudio==1.0.2 ` and not `simpleaudio=1.0.2 `
